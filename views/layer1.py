        Layer 1 has three themes you'll work through in order:

        1. **Logical Reasoning**: abstract sequence puzzles. You'll see a row
           of figures with one slot missing, and pick the figure that
           continues the pattern.
        2. **Numerical Reasoning**: short charts and tables, followed by a
           multiple-choice question about the data.
        3. **Verbal Reasoning**: a short passage followed by a statement.
           You decide whether the statement is **True**, **False**, or
           **Cannot Say** based only on the passage.

        Each theme has **{QUESTIONS_PER_THEME} questions** and its own
        **time block, not a per-question timer**. The clock runs continuously
        over the whole theme. When the theme block ends, any unanswered
        questions are marked wrong and you move on to the next theme. You
        cannot revisit questions once answered.

        ### Before you begin, please make sure you have:
        - 📝 **Pen and paper** for working through problems
        - 🧮 **A calculator** (the numerical theme requires arithmetic on
          percentages, ratios, and multi-step figures)
        - 🪑 A quiet, uninterrupted environment for the next ~35 minutes

        Pick the best answer; you will not see whether you got each
        question right.

        - **Don't overthink it.** If you've stared for 30 seconds and nothing
          clicks, pick your best guess and move on. Wrong answers cost the
          same as no answer, and no answer is guaranteed wrong.

            ### Sequence reasoning

            Each question shows a row of figures with one missing slot. The
            figures change from left to right according to a pattern: rotation,
            shape changes, additions, counting, or shading. Work out the
            pattern, then pick the option (A-E) that fits the missing slot.

            ### How the patterns work

            Patterns can involve any combination of:
            - **Shape changes**: squares to triangles, open to filled
            - **Rotation**: figures turning 45° or 90° each step
            - **Addition or subtraction**: elements appearing or
              disappearing across the sequence
            - **Counting**: number of dots, lines, or shapes increasing
              or decreasing
            - **Color or shading**: alternating, inverting, or combining

            ### Tips before you start

            - **Look at the change between adjacent figures first.** The
              step-by-step rule is usually easier to spot than the whole
              pattern at once.
            - **Eliminate impossible options.** Even if you can't see the
              full pattern, you can usually rule out 2-3 options quickly.
